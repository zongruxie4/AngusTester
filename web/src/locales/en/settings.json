Adding and Installing Agents: Before executing tasks, you need to add nodes and install agents for the nodes. If automatic agent installation fails due to network or server account issues, please follow the manual installation prompts. Please ensure that the agent is in a connected state before executing tasks (if the agent is not started, you need to start the agent first). 3. Node Role Configuration: A node can take on multiple roles, but to improve the accuracy of performance test results, please configure a single \"execution\" node role for stress test nodes. 4. Network Environment Selection: During stress testing, if you want to restore the user's real access environment (such as network latency) as much as possible, please use public network nodes for testing. If you want to exclude network latency interference on test results to test the application's ultimate performance, please add nodes in the same intranet environment as the test application for testing. 5. By default, only system administrators and application administrators are allowed to perform management operations on nodes.",
